# Simbolo Data Science Bootcamp â€“ Class Project

This repository contains my class project for the **Simbolo Data Science Bootcamp**. The project demonstrates the application of data science concepts and techniques learned during the bootcamp, including data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  To showcase practical data science skills through a real-world dataset and end-to-end analysis.

- **Contents:**  
  - Data exploration and cleaning  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Data visualization  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Model building and evaluation  
  - Conclusions and insights

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`  
  Jupyter notebooks containing the main analysis and modeling steps.

- `data/`  
  Sample datasets used for the project (if available).

- `src/`  
  Python scripts for data processing and utility functions.

- `outputs/`  
  Generated plots, reports, and model outputs.

- `requirements.txt`  
  List of Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/feniz24/simbolo_ds_bootcamp.git
    cd simbolo_ds_bootcamp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open and run the notebooks:**
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    - Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open the main project notebook.
